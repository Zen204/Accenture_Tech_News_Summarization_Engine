# Tech News Summarization Engine

## Overview
Welcome to the Tech News Summarization Engine! This project, developed in collaboration with **Accenture**, leverages cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to provide concise summaries of the latest tech news articles. The tool is designed to help users stay informed with minimal effort by distilling lengthy articles into their key points.

## Features
- **Automated Summarization:** Extracts the main ideas from articles with high accuracy.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Provides insights into the tone of the news (e.g., positive, neutral, negative).
- **Customizable Summaries:** Adjust the length and depth of summaries based on user preferences.
- **Keyword Extraction:** Highlights the most important terms and topics in each article.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean, intuitive interface for seamless interaction.

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection:** The engine scrapes and aggregates tech news from various reputable sources.
2. **Preprocessing:** Cleans and normalizes text data to ensure accurate analysis.
3. **Summarization:** Utilizes advanced NLP algorithms (e.g., TextRank, BERT) to generate summaries.
4. **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzes the emotional tone using pre-trained sentiment models.
5. **Output:** Provides users with concise summaries, key insights, and sentiment details.


## Usage
1. Launch the application and input a URL or upload a news article file.
2. Select your desired summary length and sentiment analysis option.
3. View the summarized output, keywords, and sentiment insights.
